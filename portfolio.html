    <p id="description">
        321OS was a project to create a tiny kernel in C. 
        It used the boot protocol Limine, and implemented interrupt handling, it could write text to the screen using the Limine text-terminal, write to serial output and had a very basic memory allocator which could allocate pages (chunks of memory that were 4 KiB - 4096 bytes in size)
        The project is now abandoned and in the future, at some point I will make a kernel or something similar using Rust rather than C.

        This was an app I created to help me learn Rust user input and string parsing. It takes questions from files in the following format: question:answer and it gives the questions and shows you the score in the end.
